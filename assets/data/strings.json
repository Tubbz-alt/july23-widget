The FCC has injured our economy and free speech in just one action, all without so much as a single public hearing.\n\nWe need members of Congress to stand up for the open internet and for the digital rights of their constituents now. Please co-sponsor, sign the discharge petition for, and vote for the CRA Resolution of Disapproval that would overturn the FCC's December \"Restoring Internet Freedom\" vote.\n\nThank you.\n",
